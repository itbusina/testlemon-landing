        { q: "What is SSL monitoring, and why is it important?", a: "SSL monitoring is the process of continuously checking the status and validity of SSL certificates on your website. It is important because it ensures that your certificates are up-to-date, preventing security risks, data breaches, and loss of user trust due to expired or misconfigured certificates." },
        { q: "How does SSL monitoring protect my website?", a: "SSL monitoring protects your website by providing real-time alerts for any issues with your SSL certificates, such as expirations errors. This proactive approach helps you address problems before they affect your website’s security and availability." },
        { q: "What happens if my SSL certificate expires?", a: "If your SSL certificate expires, your website will no longer be considered secure. Users may receive warnings when attempting to access your site, leading to a loss of trust and potential traffic. SSL monitoring helps prevent this by sending alerts before expiration." },
        { q: "Is SSL monitoring difficult to set up?", a: "No, setting up SSL monitoring is usually straightforward. Check the documentation, usually it takes no longer than 5 minutes." },
