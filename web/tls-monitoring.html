        { q: "Why is TLS monitoring important?", a: "TLS monitoring is crucial because it helps organizations protect sensitive data from cyber threats. By monitoring TLS configurations, companies can identify weaknesses, ensure compliance with security standards, and prevent data breaches." },
        { q: "Can TLS monitoring help with compliance requirements?", a: "Yes, TLS monitoring can assist with compliance by providing insights into how TLS configurations meet industry standards (such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR). Regular monitoring and reporting help organizations maintain compliance and avoid penalties." },
        { q: "How often should I monitor my TLS configurations?", a: "It’s recommended to monitor TLS configurations continuously or at regular intervals, depending on the organization’s needs. Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection of vulnerabilities or issues, while regular assessments help maintain overall security." },
